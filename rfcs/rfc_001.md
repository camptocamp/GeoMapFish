# RFC 001 - custom frontends for GeoMapish

## Motivation

- there will be a new geogirafe frontend that will use the geomapfish backend / deployment solution.
- there are possible alternative frontends like masterportal
- there is a need for developping custom components in any technology

## Current situation / problems

When scaffolding a geomapfish project, the build tools and default interfaces are copied and ngeo/gmf source code is added as dependency.

The GeoMapish frontend is non-selectable: it is Ngeo/GMF. Even the version of that frontend must be the same as the backend. This is not flexible.

The build tool, from ngeo/gmf raw sources, requires complex transformations due to AngularJS injection mechanism and transformation of some imported files. It is both complex and constraining.

## Vision

- No breaking change for current usages
- No change in the way geomapfish is deployed
- No change in the backend protocol
- New mechanism is simple and opt-in;

- New possibilities:
  - consume pre-built ngeo/gmf packages in a totally custom and standard HTML/javascript project;
  - or even withtout any dependency on ngeo/gmf packages (ex: geogirafe, masterportal)
  - integrate seemlesly with the existing backend and deployment mechanism
  - Ability to use any build system, frontend framework, or package and in any version

## Technical proposition

### Creation of a custom frontend

There will be a `frontend` directory at the root of the Geomapfish project. This directory will contain the custom frontend project.

In this folder the developer should add everything needed to build the frontend like a `package.json`, the custom components, the build tools, the interface html files, etc.

This folder will contain a `Dockerfile`, in charge of building this custom frontend project.
The content is up to the developer, the only constraint is to put the generated files in the `/etc/static-frontend` directory.

Each interface html file must contain the header metadata `dynamicUrl`, pointing to the used `dynamic.json` like: `/dynamic.json` (used by ngeo).
These interfaces will be served by the backend on `/` and `/theme/<name>`.

The other files in the `frontend` directory will be served by the backend on the path `/static-frontend/<file>`.
These paths should be correctly referenced in the html files.

Note: above I consider the entry point as `/` but it should be correcty nanaged by the frontend Docker image if needed.

Note: the i18n should be managed by the frontend project, the backend will only provide language files with localized string related to the backend (like the layer names).

Default custom frontend: the demo will provide a working example, in addition, documentation will be added in the GeoMapFish documentation.

### Integration of the custom frontend

In `c2cgeoportal` we will add a new static route to serve the frontend files from `/etc/static-frontend` directory on the `/static-frontend` path.

In the `c2cgeoportal` configuration we will add a new interface type `custom` (currently we have `ngeo` and `canvas`).

The interface will be defined as:

```yaml
name: desktop  # The name of the interface
type: custom
file: desktop.html  # The html file name
```

If needed a mako boolean can be added to the interface definition if we need to render the html file with mako.

If needed the file can be a glob pattern if there is an hash in the filename.

### Prebuild of the ngeo npm package

The npm package is distributed on npmjs.
A pre-built version will be added in the "prebuilt" path.
This transformation will allow consumption of the transformed ngeo source code by any build tool (webpack, parcel, vite, rollup, ...).

### Hooks / components to interaction

On a case-by-case basis, we will add hooks / base components to `ngeo`. That could be:

- promises, to share object that never change like the map, the initial permalink.
- stores (RxJS or eventially Signal), to share the AngularJS states as read only.
- functions, to be able to modify the angular state.
- Web components (implemented with Lit).
